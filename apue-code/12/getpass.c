/* A simple program to illustrate the options of
 * getting a secret from a user.  Note that we are
 * reading input from stdin, so we can't juse prompt
 * the user for the password there.  Fortunately,
 * getpass(3) does the right thing already.
 *
 * Try it as:
 * - echo foo | ./a.out
 * - echo foo | env SECRET=moo ./a.out
 * - ./a.out password
 *
 * Use the debugger to inspect the secret in memory
 * after we change where 'secret' points to and / or
 * inspect the core dump after we called abort(3):
 * $ echo | ./a.out asdasd
 * $ strings a.out.core | grep asdasd
 *
 * Note also that the stdout buffer retains the
 * secret, as well as getpass(3) internally;
 * getpass_r(3) can help so you can zero out the
 * password, but to avoid the stdout buffer, you'd
 * need to use unbuffered I/O.
